TODO
1. Perform recovery on the diagnosis table
2. Add admin can view diagnosis however most of the records must be hide
3. Doctor can perform undo action on the diagnosis part


CHECK:
2. Backup databse
    - We use build in job (sp_add_jobstep) to create backup job so that we can capture the backup history 
    - Schedule action we use crontab since in docker we can't use sqlagent.  
    - Things can achieve:
        -> able to automatic run the backup base on a given time / duration
        -> able to capture the backup history
