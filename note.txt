TODO
1. Undo function
    -> Specify the id of the user
2. DCL Auditting

CHECK:
2. Backup databse
    - We use build in job (sp_add_jobstep) to create backup job so that we can capture the backup history 
    - Schedule action we use crontab since in docker we can't use sqlagent.  
    - Things can achieve:
        -> able to automatic run the backup base on a given time / duration
        -> able to capture the backup history
